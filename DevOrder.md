1. **Authentication:**  
   Implementing authentication first ensures that your application has a secure foundation. It will also allow you to test user-specific features as you develop them.

2. **File Storage:**  
   Setting up file storage early on will provide a place to store notes and assignments which will be central to many of the other features.

3. **Document Upload (Module 1):**  
   This module is fundamental as it populates your application with the data it will work on. The OCR and classification functionality will also be foundational for other features.

4. **Summarizer (Module 2):**  
   With some data in your system from Module 1, you can now work on summarization. This feature is relatively standalone and can provide early value to users.

5. **Flashcard/Mock Exam Generator (Module 3):**  
   This module can leverage the classified and summarized data from the previous modules. It's a more complex feature that will provide significant value to users.

6. **Chat Interface:**  
   Implementing the chat interface at this stage makes sense as it can leverage data and functionalities from the previous modules. Additionally, integrating Cohere's RAG model and LangChain Agents could be complex, so having the other modules in place first may be helpful.

7. **Integration with LangChain Agents:**  
   With the previous modules in place, integrating LangChain Agents will allow for interfacing between modules and enhance the overall functionality of your application.

8. **Continuous Improvement and Testing:**  
   Throughout the development process, ensure you are collecting feedback, conducting testing, and making iterative improvements to each module.  
   Consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment, ensuring that each new feature or modification doesn't introduce bugs.

9. **User Interface (UI) Enhancements:**  
   Continually improve the UI/UX based on user feedback, and consider adding any additional features or integrations that will enhance the user experience.

10. **Optimization and Scalability:**  
    Optimize the performance of your application and ensure it is ready to scale as the user base grows.

11. **Deployment:**  
    Once all features are implemented and tested, deploy your application to a production environment.

12. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**  
    After deployment, set up monitoring tools to track the application's performance, and maintain the system to ensure ongoing stability and reliability.  
    By following this order, you can build out the core functionality of your application early on, ensuring that each new module builds upon a solid and tested foundation.
