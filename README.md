[API Endpoint Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16996416/2s9Y)

Every student embarks on a unique academic journey, filled with challenges that span from comprehending feedback on assignments to acing exams. Recognizing knowledge gaps is one thing, but bridging them effectively? That's a monumental task. Enter **FlaimBrain**—your personalized AI-powered academic mentor, tailored to support every student's individual learning curve. 🚀

## 🤖 FlaimBrain At A Glance

FlaimBrain transcends the capabilities of standard chatbots. By allowing users to upload and scan files, this intelligent bot lends its expertise in summarizing notes, crafting flashcards, proposing study guides, and devising mock assessments—all based on the material you provide. It's not just about providing feedback; it's about aligning that feedback with a student's unique learning trajectory. This ensures that FlaimBrain doesn't just assist; it revolutionizes the way students engage with their academic materials.

## 🔧 Our Journey in Crafting FlaimBrain

Our elegant frontend is the fusion of TypeScript and React.js, while the true genius—our backend—capitalizes on the strengths of Langchain, Flask, MongoDB, and the impressive capabilities of the GPT-4 model. Yet, our journey was not without its fair share of challenges. With MongoDB's recent foray into cloud vector databases on MongoDB Atlas in June 2023, we found ourselves in unfamiliar waters. Sparse examples and limited resources paired with potential systemic issues with MongoDB during our hackathon period kept us on our toes. But as every challenge brought a new learning curve, it also fueled our determination to persevere.

## 🏆 From Novices to Innovators

Our proudest moment? Watching our backend team, primarily composed of newbies, conquer formidable challenges. We embarked on a whirlwind journey: from building APIs, mastering MongoDB databases, integrating AI technologies, to experimenting with Google Cloud Vision and myriad Python libraries. Delving headfirst into the vast universe of artificial intelligence, LangChain, OpenAI, and LLMs became not just a task but an exhilarating adventure!

## 📚 Our Academic Endeavour

Our journey mirrored the academic process. We became students, soaking up knowledge from Cohere's LLMU. The art of vector database management, Flask API endpoint creation, and strategic system design became our syllabus. And as we grew, so did our expertise in React and the effective deployment of ChatGPT 4, from browsing to DALL-E integration.

## 🚀 The Future Beckons

As we gaze into FlaimBrain's future, the horizon promises further innovation. We envision incorporating memory-enhancing features, much like those of ChatGPT, into LangChain. And with plans to broaden our file compatibility spectrum, FlaimBrain is poised to become an indispensable companion in every student's academic voyage.

Join us as we redefine learning. With FlaimBrain, students aren't just studying—they're thriving. 📖🤝
